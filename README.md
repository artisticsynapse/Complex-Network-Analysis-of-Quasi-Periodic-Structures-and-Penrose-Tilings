# Complex-Network-Analysis-of-Quasi-Periodic-Structures-and-Penrose-Tilings
Project on analyzing the non-linear dynamics, and the networks of a Quasi Periodic structures, in a search for patterns. 

Hello, This is an independent-JHU affiliated project on complex network analysis.
We would be progressively working on the project; involves data accumulation, methods, analysis, 
and our approach towards the application of this analysis.

Please drop in a message if you'd like to use the data, or have any specific doubts regarding the same.
Collaborations are highly appreciated. Thank you.
